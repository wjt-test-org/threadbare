This simple stealth scene includes guards and a collectible. Use the nodes in the Scene Tree to build a level.
Notice the tile map is built with multiple layers. This makes it easier to make changes to the environment.
Click a node, like "Player" or "Guard1" and modify their properties in the Inspector, or add new elements.
Don't be afraid to think outside the box. (Oh, and remove or replace this text!)
