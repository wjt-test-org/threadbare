description = "Stella and the Missing Star follows a young girl who journeys across the globe to restore a missing star from her favorite constellation. Guided by curiosity and gratitude, Stella travels to Guatemala, Northern Australia, and the Kalahari Desert, where she meets cultural guardians who each interpret the missing star through their own perspectives. The encounters show how stories shape the way we see the stars - and ourselves."
