class_name Shaker
extends Node2D

## Node that applies a shake to a target by applying a shift in its position
## and rotation over time.
## Useful for visual effects like characters being attacked or camera shakes.

## Emitted when the target starts shaking
signal started
## Emitted when the target stopped shaking
signal finished

## Node that will be shaked
@export var target: CanvasItem
## Maximum possible value in which the position of the node might be offset.
@export_range(1.0, 100.0, 1.0, "or_greater", "or_less") var shake_intensity: float = 30.0
## How much time (in seconds) the node will be shaken.
@export_range(0.5, 5.0, 0.1, "or_greater", "or_less", "suffix:s") var duration: float = 1.5
## Higher frequencies means that the node's position will be offset faster.
@export_range(1.0, 30.0, 1.0, "or_greater", "or_less") var frequency: float = 10.0
## Test out the shake parameters in the editor
@warning_ignore("unused_private_class_variable")
@export_tool_button("Test") var _test: Callable = shake

## Noise used to generate random values between -1 and 1
var noise: FastNoiseLite = FastNoiseLite.new()
## Original position of the node, this is used to return the node to its
## original position when the effect stops.
var original_position: Vector2
## Original rotation of the node, this is used to return the node to its
## original rotation when the effect stops.
var original_rotation: float
## Time incremented every frame of the effect to sample a different
## value from the noise.
var time_passed: float = 0.0
## How much the noise value (which goes from -1 to 1) is amplified.
## It decreases since the shake starts until it reaches 0.
var current_intensity: float = 0.0
## Reference to the tween that will decrease the [member current_intensity]
var shake_tween: Tween

## Shake the node's position by a maximum of [param intensity] and rotation by
## a maximum of [param intensity] * 0.01 during [param time].
## When the effect finishes, [member target]'s position and rotation end up
## at the same values it had before the effect started. [br]
## If shake is called a second time before it finishes, the new effect will
## override the previous one, and when that shake effect finishes,
## the [member target]'s position and rotation will end up at the values it
## had before the first shake effect started. [br]
## Emits the [signal started] signal as soon as it's called. [br]
## If the shake is called multiple times, it will only emit the [signal
## finished] signal when the last effect is completed.
## After the shake happens the target could have been freed, so consider that to avoid an error.
