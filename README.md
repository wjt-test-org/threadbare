# Threadbare


A story-driven, collaborative game where players don’t just explore a world—they co-create it. In Threadbare, players rebuild a world unraveling at the seams by recovering knowledge, crafting stories, and designing characters, quests, and cultures drawn from their own lives.

**Threadbare is currently in pre-alpha** and being used in select learning programs as a scaffolded learning experience. Learners create non-canon StoryQuests that live alongside the canon narrative. In the future, contributors will be able to contribute canon LoreQuests to the core narrative of Threadbare.

[Play the current pre-alpha release of Threadbare](https://endlessm.github.io/threadbare/), or [play development versions](https://endlessm.github.io/threadbare/branches/). New pre-alpha releases are published every 2–3 weeks.

## Help Build Threadbare!

Threadbare is open source! We invite interested learners, educators, or game developers to follow along with its development and get involved where possible. The core team determines the overall game design and direction (ensuring it serves both players and learners), but anyone can join the community to find a place to help out:

- [Share playtest feedback](https://github.com/endlessm/threadbare/discussions/categories/playtest-feedback)
- [Ask and answer questions](https://github.com/endlessm/threadbare/discussions/categories/q-a)
- [Browse good first issues](https://github.com/endlessm/threadbare/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) to find something to tackle
- [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/mNtzvvaFXF) to discuss the project with the team in real-time

Threadbare's code, comments, and development discussion are written in English.
If English is not your first language, don't worry: it's not the first language
for about half of the core team at Endless Access either, and we will be happy
to hear from you.

(We hope to add translations for the game itself in the medium term.)
