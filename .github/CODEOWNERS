# CODEOWNERS
#
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more users or teams. Order is
# important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence. When someone
# opens a pull request that only modifies files matching a pattern farther down,
# only the last-matching owner(s) and not the global owner(s) will be requested
# for a review.
#
# Prefer listing teams instead of individual users whenever possible for easier
# access management.
#
# This is a living document mapping expertise to the codebase; it can and should
# be updated over time! See: https://opensauced.pizza/blog/shared-ownership-culture
